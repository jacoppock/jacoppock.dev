LangChain is a powerful framework for building applications with large language models (LLMs). It provides a set of tools and abstractions that make it easier to create context-aware and reasoning-capable applications.

Key features:
- Composable components for working with language models
- Off-the-shelf chains for common tasks
- Integrations with various data sources and tools
- Support for building custom agents and workflows

This project is a fork of the original LangChain repository, allowing for customization and experimentation with the framework.
