UNETR (UNet Transformers) is an innovative architecture that leverages the power of transformers for 3D medical image segmentation. This repository provides an unofficial implementation of the UNETR model described in the paper by Ali Hatamizadeh et al.

Key features:
- Transformer-based architecture for 3D medical image segmentation
- Combines the strengths of UNet and transformers
- Designed for high-performance segmentation tasks in medical imaging

This project is a fork of an unofficial implementation, allowing for further experimentation and development of the UNETR architecture.
